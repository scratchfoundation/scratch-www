### Where am I? ###
Physically? No idea.

Digitally? You’re at Scratch’s open source Web Client! 

At Scratch, we’re working to update our UI to use a new codebase, which will be contained in this repository. The transition from existing to new codebase is an ongoing process, and we love to have people in the Scratch and Open Source communities help us along the way, and even afterwards as we develop new features for Scratch here.


### Who and what will I find here? ###
We are always excited to have people join us in working to make Scratch a wonderful place for people of all ages to make projects together. If you’re new here, and looking to jump into our wonderful community, we have some wonderful resources for you to take a look at:

* [README](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-www/blob/develop/README.md) (if you’re to read only one me in this repo, make it this one – it has all of the necessary information for getting a local Scratch UI running on your machine!)
* [Community Guidelines](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-www/wiki/Community-Guidelines) (we find it important to maintain a constructive and welcoming community, just like on Scratch)
* [Issues](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-www/issues) – where we keep track of all the things that need fixin’ on the website
Road map

Beyond this repo, there are also some other resources that you might want to take a look at:
Scratch (the thing we work on)
Bugs & Glitches forum on Scratch (where mosquitoes and dei ex machina congregate)
Advanced Topics forum on Scratch (like Topics, but more complex-y)
