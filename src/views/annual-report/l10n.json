    "annualReport.messageTitle": "Message from the Scratch Team",
    "annualReport.messageP1": "2019 was a year of great progress for Scratch. We started the year with the launch of Scratch 3.0, our newest generation of Scratch, designed to spark children’s creativity and engage children with diverse interests and backgrounds. We celebrated the end of the year with our team moving from MIT into its new home at the Scratch Foundation, in a playful first-floor space near South Station in Boston. Throughout the year, the Scratch community continued to thrive and grow: More than 20 million young people created projects with Scratch in 2019, an increase of 48% over the year before.",
    "annualReport.messageP2": "The impact and importance of Scratch have been highlighted in 2020 as the COVID pandemic forced schools to close. Activity in the Scratch online community more than doubled as young people, confined to their homes, turned to Scratch to express themselves creatively and connect with one another. Scratchers have also been actively engaged in Black Lives Matter and other movements for racial justice and equity, creating animated projects and studios to spread awareness and demand change.",
    "annualReport.messageP3": "From the time we launched Scratch in 2007, we have always seen Scratch as more than a programming language. Scratch provides opportunities for all young people, from all backgrounds, to develop their voices, express their ideas, and collaborate with one another. We love to see the ways that Scratchers have responded to recent societal challenges with creativity, collaboration, caring, and kindness.",
    "annualReport.messageP4": "In this Annual Report, we’ll share more about the mission, plans, impact, and reach of Scratch, supported with examples of how Scratch is expanding learning opportunities for a broad diversity of young people around the world, both in schools and throughout their lives.",
