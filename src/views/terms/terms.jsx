                <p>
                    2.1 In order to use some features of the Services, you will need to
                    register with Scratch and create an account. Creating an account is
                    optional, but without an account you will not be able to save or
                    publish projects or comments on Scratch. When registering for a
                    personal account, you will be asked to provide certain personal
                    information, such as your email address, gender, birth month and
                    year, and country. Please see Scratch&#39;s{' '}

                <p>
                    2.2 You are responsible for keeping your password secret and your
                    account secure. You are solely responsible for any use of your
                    account, even if your account is used by another person. If any use
                    of your account violates the Terms of Service, your account may be
                    suspended or deleted.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    2.4 Account names cannot be changed. If you want a different account name,
                    create a new account and copy your existing projects over by hand.
                </p>

                    of your password), promptly change your password. If you cannot access

                <p>
                    3.1 The Scratch Team supports freedom of expression. However, Scratch is
                    intended for a wide audience, and some content is inappropriate for the
                    Scratch community. You may not use the Scratch service in any way, that:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Promotes bigotry, discrimination, hatred, or violence against any
                            individual or group;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Threatens, harasses, or intimidates any other person, whether that

                        </li>
                        <li>Contains foul language or personal attacks;</li>
                        <li>Contains sexually explicit or graphically violent material;</li>
                        <li>
                            Provides instructions on how to commit illegal activities or obtain
                            illegal products;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Except in connection with organizing Scratch day events, asks any
                            other user for personally identifying information, contact
                            information, or passwords; or
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Exposes any others person&#39;s personally identifying information,
                            contact information, or passwords without that person&#39;s permission.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.3 You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations when you use
                    Scratch. You may not use Scratch in any unlawful way, including to harass,

                <p>
                    3.5 You agree not to use Scratch in any way intended to disrupt the service,
                    gain unauthorized access to the service, or interfere with any other user&#39;s
                    ability to use the service. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited
                    to:

                        <li>
                            Posting content deliberately designed to crash the Scratch

                        <li>
                            Using alternate accounts or organizing voting groups to manipulate
                            site statistics, such as purposely trying to get on the &#34;What the
                            Community is Loving/Remixing&#34; rows of the front page.
                        </li>

                    the Scratch Team reserves the right to block any commercial use
                    of Scratch that, in the Scratch Team&#39;s sole discretion, is harmful
                    to the community. Harmful commercial use includes spamming or
                    repeated advertisement through projects, comments, or forum posts.

                <p>
                    4.1 For the purposes of the Terms of Use, &#34;user-generated content&#34;
                    includes any projects, comments, forum posts, or links to third
                    party websites that a user submits to Scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.2 The Scratch Team encourages everyone to foster creativity by
                    freely sharing code, art, music, and other works. However, we
                    also understand the need for individuals and companies to protect
                    their intellectual property rights. You are responsible for making
                    sure you have the necessary rights, licenses, or permission for
                    any user-generated content you submit to Scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.3 All user-generated content you submit to Scratch is licensed
                    to and through Scratch under the{' '}
                    <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">
                        Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 license</a>. This
                    allows others to view and remix your content. This license also
                    allows the Scratch Team to display, distribute, and reproduce
                    your content on the Scratch website, through social media
                    channels, and elsewhere. If you do not want to license your
                    content under this license, then do not share it on Scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.4 You may only submit user-generated projects that were created
                    with (1) the Scratch website editor or (2) an unmodified copy of
                    the Scratch editor compiled from the source code described in
                    Section 5.3. You may not upload any projects that were created, by
                    you or by anyone else, with a modified version of the Scratch editor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.5 Although the Scratch Team requires all users to comply with
                    these Terms of Use, some inappropriate user-generated content
                    may be submitted and displayed on the Scratch website. You
                    understand that when you use Scratch you may be exposed to
                    user-generated content that you find objectionable or offensive.
                    If you see any content that violates the Community Guidelines
                    or Terms of Use, please let us know by using the &#34;Report this&#34;
                    button. You only need to report an item once. The Scratch Team
                    reviews reported content every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.6 In addition to reviewing reported user-generated content, the
                    Scratch Team reserves the right, but is not obligated, to monitor
                    all uses of the Scratch service. The Scratch Team may edit, move,
                    or delete any content that violates the Terms of Use or Community
                    Guidelines, without notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.7 All user-generated content is provided as-is. The Scratch Team
                    makes no warranties about the accuracy or reliability of any
                    user-generated content available through Scratch and does not
                    endorse Scratch Day events or vet or verify information posted in
                    connection with said events. The Scratch Team does not endorse any
                    views, opinions, or advice expressed in user-generated content. You
                    agree to relieve the Scratch Team of any and all liability arising
                    from your user-generated content and from Scratch Day events you

                    Scratch is offered by the Scratch Team from its facilities in the United
                    States. The Scratch Team makes no representations that Scratch is

                    or use Scratch are responsible for compliance with local law.

                <p>
                    You agree that these Terms of Use, for all purposes, shall be governed
                    and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
                    Massachusetts applicable to contracts to be wholly performed therein,
                    and any action based on, relating to, or alleging a breach of the
                    Terms of Use must be brought in a state or federal court in Suffolk
                    County, Massachusetts. In addition, both parties agree to submit to
                    the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

                    If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United

                    accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then
                    those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government
