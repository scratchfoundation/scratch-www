                        access and receive information about the Personal
                        Information we maintain about you, to update and correct

                        or object to the processing of your Personal

                        your right to data portability to easily transfer your
                        Personal Information to another company. Those rights
                        may be limited in some circumstances by local law
                        requirements. In addition to the above-mentioned rights,

                        withdraw it at any time and free of charge. When you do
                        so, this will not affect the lawfulness of the

                <p>
                    We take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep
                    it in a form that does not allow you to be identified when
                    this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for
                    which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep
                    this information for a longer period. When determining the
                    retention period, we take into account various criteria,
                    such as the type of services requested by or provided to
                    you, the nature and length of our relationship with you,
                    possible re-enrolment with our services, the impact on the
                    services we provide to you if we delete some information
                    from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by
                    law and the statute of limitations.

                <h3>How does the Scratch Team protect my personal information?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Scratch Team has in place administrative, physical, and
                    technical procedures that are intended to protect the
                    information we collect on the Scratch website against
                    accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss,
                    unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access,
                    misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the
                    Personal Information in our possession. For example, we
                    use SSL/TLS for all data transfer and strictly limit access
                    to the Scratch servers and the data we store on them. However,
                    as effective as these measures are, no security system is
                    impenetrable. We cannot completely guarantee the security of
                    our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you
                    supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us
                    over the Internet.

                    We review our security measures and Privacy Policy on a
                    periodic basis, and we may modify our policies as
